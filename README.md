# Scientific Calculator - DSA Project

Welcome to the Scientific Calculator project repository, developed as a project for the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course. This repository contains a C++ program for a basic scientific calculator. This calculator can perform various mathematical operations, including basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, logarithms, and more.

## Introduction

This scientific calculator supports various mathematical operations, including:
- Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)
- Logarithms (log, ln)
- Exponents (N^J)
- Square roots (V)
- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)

## Requirements

- the calculator should have + - / x   
- Basic trigonometry function: sin cos tan 
- More than basic function: square root, exp, log, ln 
- The calculator can input up to 10 or more variables and parameters. It is not limited to 2 + 2, 3 x 3, etc. 
- Inside the code, you apply the class function (separate class, inline class, constructor, etc.) 
- Inside the code, you apply the linked list or queue function
- It can delete and show the history of the calculator

## Prerequisites

To compile and run this program, you'll need:

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++) installed on your system.
- A text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-manager-cpp.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
Copy code
cd password-manager-cpp
```

3. Compile the program:

```bash
Copy code
g++ password_manager.cpp -o password_manager
```

4. Run the password manager:

```bash
Copy code
./password_manager
```

### Usage

- The calculator has a simple command-line interface.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to perform calculations.
- Use the specified keywords or symbols to select operations.

## Sample Equations

For testing purposes, some equations are provided as examples:
- Equation 1: 1 + 1 - 2 / 2 + sin90 + cos0 + tan45 + V4 + 2^2 + log(100) = 12
- Equation 2: 1 + (1 - 2) / 2 + sin90 + cos(1-1) + tan(15*3) + V(8/2) + log(100)^2 + log2(2^2) = 11.5
- Equation 3: 1 + (2 + 4/(1+1))/2 + sin90 + cos(10*0) + tan((3*5)*3) + V((2*6)+V16) + log(50*2)^2 + log2((2^2)*4)

Feel free to use these equations for testing the calculator's functionalities.
